# cemeteryjs

Cemetery.js will be an online game editor built on top of babylon.js (later maybe other game engines will be supported too).
The main goal is to create a plugin-based editor and make it as open as possible to other contributors.

The development is still in quite early phases, demo site is coming soon (at the latest in December of 2020).
